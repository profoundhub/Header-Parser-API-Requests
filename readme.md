- This website was created for the Free Code Camp (FCC) Back End API Request Header Parser Micro Service project. It exposes a single endpoint at /api/v1/whoami which returns information about your IP address, locale, and the OS you are using in a JSON format.

### RAW:
- Sample output: {"ipaddress":"123.456.789.101","language":"EN-GB","software":"Windows NT X; Win128; x256"}

## Usage
- The endpoint can be found at: https://fcc-header-parser.herokuapp.com/api/v1/whoami .

## Source Code
- The source code can be located in my GitHub Repo: https://github.com/profoundhub/FCC-Request-Header-Parser-Microservice .
